      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the milk, yeast and sugar.</li>
        <li>Mix until the yeast has completely dissolved and set aside for 10-15 minutes, until the mixture starts to froth.</li>
        <li>Add the egg yolks, melted butter and vanilla. Stir.</li>
        <li>Add the orange zest, salt and half of the flour. Stir.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining flour and stir with a spoon as thoroughly as possible.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to another bowl that has been lightly brushed with oil. Dust with some flour and cover with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Set aside for 1-2 hours at room temperature so that it can rise.</li>
        <li>When ready, dust your hands with flour so that the dough doesnâ€™t stick to them and shape dough in to a ball.</li>
        <li>Dust a working surface with flour and roll out the dough until it is 1cm thick. You can roll out the dough up to 3 times. Do not overwork it or else the donuts will not come out as light and fluffy as they should.</li>
        <li>Use a 10 cm round cookie cutter to cut out a donut and use a smaller one to cut out a small circle in the middle.</li>
        <li>Repeat the same process until you run out of dough. This recipe yields 8 donuts. (Reserve 2 small balls of dough so you can test if the oil is hot enough.</li>
        <li>Dust the donuts with some flour, cover with a towel and let them rest and rise again for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a deep pan, (It should be about 5 cm deep) until it reaches 175*C (347*F). Test it with the small balls of dough you reserved.</li>
        <li>When the oil is ready, add the donuts to the pan and fry for 1-2 minutes on the first side. When golden, turn them over and fry for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from pan and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Allow them to drain from excess oil and cool for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the white glaze by combining the icing sugar, vanilla and milk in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Prepare the chocolate glaze by combining the icing sugar, cocoa powder and milk in a small bowl. Add a little more milk if necessary.</li>
        <li>Decorate the donuts any way you like with the 2 glazes, jelly and sprinkles.</li>
